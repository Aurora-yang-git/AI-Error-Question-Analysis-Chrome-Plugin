A Chrome extension designed for AP students that automatically analyzes multiple-choice questions on College Board AP Classroom using Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano AI. It identifies student misconceptions and provides Socratic guidance to help students self-correct their errors.

---

## ✨ Core Features

### 🎯 Smart Analysis
- **Subject Detection**: Automatically identifies 13 AP subjects, AI uses subject-specific terminology and frameworks
- **Misconception Identification**: Deep analysis based on College Board official explanations (A-D options)
- **Socratic Guidance**: Guides students to think independently rather than giving direct answers
- **LaTeX Rendering**: Perfect display of mathematical formulas and physics symbols

### 📚 Misconception Bank
- **Smart Deduplication**: Automatically merges identical questions and tracks error counts
- **Subject Classification**: Filter mistakes by AP subject
- **One-Click Export**: Export as JSON/CSV format
- **Local Storage**: Data saved locally in browser for privacy

### 🌐 Community Features (Optional)
- **Feedback System**: 👍 👎 feedback on analysis quality
- **Community Recommendations**: View analyses with high approval ratings (helpful ratio > 60%)

### ⚡ Automation
- **Auto-Scan**: Automatically analyzes when visiting question pages (can be disabled via popup)
- **Result Caching**: Same questions won't be re-analyzed (1-hour validity)
- **Floating Panel**: Non-intrusive analysis panel that doesn't interfere with webpage content

## 📥 Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Chrome Browser Version**: 138 or higher
- **Enable Gemini Nano**:
  1. Visit `chrome://flags`
  2. Search for "Prompt API for Gemini Nano"
  3. Set to "Enabled"
  4. Restart browser

### Installation Steps
1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked extension"
5. Select the `dist/` folder

### Optional: Supabase Configuration

The extension works perfectly without any configuration. However, if you want to enable cloud sync features (recommended analyses, user feedback statistics), you can configure Supabase:

1. See [SETUP_SUPABASE.md](SETUP_SUPABASE.md) for detailed instructions
2. Copy `supabase-config.example.js` to `supabase-config.js` and fill in your credentials
3. Run `npm run build` to rebuild the extension

**Note**: Without Supabase configuration, the extension runs in local-only mode with all core features available.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- ✅ **Local AI**: Uses Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano, all analysis done locally on device
- ✅ **No Network Requests**: Core functionality doesn't depend on external servers
- ✅ **Local Data**: Misconception bank stored locally in browser (`chrome.storage.local`)
- ✅ **Anonymous Feedback**: Supabase only stores URL hashes (SHA-256), not original URLs
